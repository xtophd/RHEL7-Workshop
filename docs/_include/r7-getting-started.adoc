== Conclusion

The set up of the RHEL 7 Workshop should now be complete.  A couple of remaining words of advice:

1.  Some exercises are dependant on the successful completion of other exercises.  Those dependencies will be noted.
2.  Pay attention to which user-id (login) to use
3.  Pay attention to which host to use
4.  There is an exam at the conclusion of the workshop... #notreally
